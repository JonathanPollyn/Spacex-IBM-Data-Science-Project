# Project introduction
This capstone project course gives the learner a taste of what data scientists face when working with actual datasets in the real world. I played the part of a Data Scientist for a firm that wanted to compete with SpaceX. I used Data Science methodology to collect data, wrangle data, embark on exploratory data analysis, visualize it, construct models, evaluate them, and communicate my findings to stakeholders.

# Programming Language
Python is the language used for this project. Some of the code was written in IBM Watson studio, especially the jupyter-labs-eda-sql-coursera.ipynb, which is due to the database not being accessed from y local machine.
